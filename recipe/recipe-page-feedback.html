		<li class="text"> Font size/selection is good, very legible.</li>
		<li class="text">Make sure your text wraps appropriately with sufficient and consistent margin/padding on all sides. In this case your left-indenting is probably unnecessarily complicated, which leads to confusing/inconsistent margins overall.</li>
		<li class="text">The centering on the 'pro tip' seems odd to me. </li>
		<li class="text">The color palette is very legible, and almost, but doesn't quite, fit with the photo and the 'concept' of the recipe. Could a few subtle adjustments lock it in?</li>
		<li class="text">The title treatment could stand some love. :)</li>
		<li class="text">The photo crop feels off-kilter, but that may just be because of the treatment of type around it.</li>
