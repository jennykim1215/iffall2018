	<h1>Postcard Triptych - Feedback to Jack Frischer</h1><br>
	<h2>Discussion Points</h2>
	<h3>Aesthetic</h3>
	<ul class="qna">
		<li class="question">Is the design beautiful/striking/remarkable?</li>
		<p class="answer">Yes, the photos are of good quality and the images fit well with the theme. Pictures chosen are good and flexible for layout of the text. Last picture mobile phone, maybe find a better quality picture?</p>
		<li class="question">Does the design aesthetic relate to the concept?</li>
		<p class="answer">Yes, all photos include Edna Mode and the font type works well too with the bold and serif style. The red text in some postcards are also nice to see. </p>
		<li class="question">Do the imagery and design choices support the text?</li>
		<p class="answer">Yes, the placement of '-Edna Mode' in every postcard makes sense and is considered. </p>
		<li class="question">Is the aesthetic consistent?</li>
		<p class="answer">Yes, same font and quality of photos are used for every postcard. </p>
		<li class="question">Is the aesthetic driving the concept, or vice-versa?</li>
		<p class="answer">Aesthetic drives the concept</p>
		<li class="question">Is it legible?</li>
		<p class="answer">Yes, very </p>
		<li class="question">Are type size/color/face/treatment choices helping or hurting?</li>
		<p class="answer">Helping, but the first one in desktop form, the font could be black because the white blends with the background a little bit </p>
	<br>
	<h3>Structure</h3>
		<li class="question">What are the designs visual priorities?</li>
		<p class="answer">For the first postcard, the picture is the priority but for the other two postcards, the text is working as the main priority. Probably due to the color and large font for postcard 2 but the negative space and emphasis for postcard 3.</p>
		<li class="question">Are design elements working in contrast, complement, or conflict?</li>
		<p class="answer">Working with complement, third one working well with contrast of light yellow image and black font. The first one is a little conflicting because type is white and the walls are also light. </p>
		<li class="question">What elements do you consider foreground? Background?</li>
		<p class="answer">For first postcard, the picture is a foreground. Other two, photos seem like the background. 'Edna Mode' in all of the postcard seems a little hidden/part of the background if that was intentional </p>
		<li class="question">Is transparency, if used, used appropriately?</li>
		<p class="answer">Transparency not used</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
		<li class="question">What happens at all of the sizes in between the desktop and mobile versions that have been provided?</li>
		<p class="answer">Text moves around well and fits into places where the eye goes</p>
		<li class="question">At what point does text collide with imagery? At what point does contrast affect legibility?</li>
		<p class="answer">Only in the first desktop postcard with the white font with light background</p>
		<li class="question">Are images presented with sufficient resolution, and without unintentional distortion or compression artifacts?</li>
		<p class="answer">Yes, except last mobile postcard, the photo could be of better quality. It stands out from the rest because of the quality </p>
		<li class="question">Have image edges all been considered and managed?</li>
		<p class="answer">Yes</p>
		<li class="question">Will elements such as fonts transfer as intended to the browser environment?</li>
		<p class="answer">seems possible</p>
		<li class="question">Can you build it?</li>
		<p class="answer">Yes it seems possible</p>
