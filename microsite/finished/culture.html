			Apart from being the national capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark and wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal in the same league as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.</p>

			<h1>
			MUSEUMS</h1>
			<p>Copenhagen has a wide array of museums of international standing. The National Museum, Nationalmuseet, is Denmark’s largest museum of archaeology and cultural history, comprising the histories of Danish and foreign cultures alike. Denmark’s National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst) is the national art museum with collections dating from the 12th century to the present.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>
			ENTERTAINMENT AND PERFORMING ARTS</h1>
			<p>The new Copenhagen Concert Hall opened in January 2009. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it has four halls with the main auditorium seating 1,800 people. It serves as the home of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and along with the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles is the most expensive concert hall ever built. Another important venue for classical music is the Tivoli Concert Hall located in the Tivoli Gardens.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>
			LITERATURE</h1>
			<p>Most of Denmarks’s major publishing houses are based in Copenhagen. These include the book publishers Gyldendal and Akademisk Forlag and newspaper publishers Berlingske and Politiken (the latter also publishing books).</p>
			<br>
			<h1>
			ART</h1>
			<p>Copenhagen has a wide selection of art museums and galleries displaying both historic works and more modern contributions. They include Statens Museum for Kunst, i.e. the Danish national art gallery, in the Østre Anlæg park, and the adjacent Hirschsprung Collection specialising in the 19th and early 20th century. Kunsthal Charlottenborg in the city centre exhibits national and international contemporary art.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>
			CUISINE</h1>
			<p>As of 2014, Copenhagen has 15 Michelin-starred restaurants, the most of any Scandinavian city. The city is increasingly recognized internationally as a gourmet destination. These include Den Røde Cottage, Formel B Restaurant, Grønbech & Churchill, Søllerød Kro, Kadeau, Kiin Kiin, the French restaurant Kong Hans Kælder, Relæ, Restaurant AOC, Noma with two Stars and Geranium with three.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>
			NIGHTLIFE AND FESTIVALS</h1>
			<p>Copenhagen has one of the highest number of restaurants and bars per capita in the world. The nightclubs and bars stay open until 5 or 6 in the morning, some even longer. Denmark has a very liberal alcohol culture and a strong tradition for beer breweries, although binge drinking is frowned upon and the Danish Police take driving under the influence very seriously.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>
			AMUSEMENT PARKS</h1>
			<p>Copenhagen has the two oldest amusement parks in the world.<br>Dyrehavsbakken, a fair-ground and pleasure-park established in 1583, is located in Klampenborg just north of Copenhagen in a forested area known as Dyrehaven. Created as an amusement park complete with rides, games and restaurants by Christian IV, it is the oldest surviving amusement park in the world.<br>The Tivoli Gardens is an amusement park and pleasure garden located in central Copenhagen between the City Hall Square and the Central Station. It opened in 1843, making it the second oldest amusement park in the world.</p>
